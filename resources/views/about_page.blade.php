  <p class="titles">Hi I'm Jacob</p><br>
  <p id="aboutText">I am from the O.C. (Orem City).  I am currently studying accounting and computer science at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.
     I work as a software engineer at Lingotek.<br><br>
<b>PROBLEM SOLVER- </b> There was a 3 hour wait line from my extended family Christmas Day for me to solve/fix/build their tech presents they received.
 In exchange for free laundry and Sunday dinners, I balance the books for my parent’s properties. I am highly effective in at least seven different ways.
  My latest victory involved synchronizing drone flight patterns for my nine year old nephews.<br><br>

<strong>PROGRAMMER- </strong> Not only do I program for work and for school but with any spare time you can find me behind my monitors with my headphones on,
 my brain ablazing and my toes tapping to the beat of “Take on Me” by a-ha. Currently I am learning and loving PHP Laravel and iOS.<br><br>

<strong>STUDENT OF LIFE-</strong> “Certain things in life will cut you open like a knife… So what will be revealed when you’re sliced open by tension and pressure?
Iron? Or air? Or bullshit?”<br>
-<i>The Obstacle is the Way</i> by Ryan Holiday<br>
 This is one of my favorite quotes, I love finding these gems as I read. When I am not coding I am most likely reading a book,
  listening to a podcast (Tim Ferriss, Freakonomics, or Revisionist History), or bonding with family and friends. </p>
